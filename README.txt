"Synthetic Control Methods for Estimating the Effect of Political Rallies During COVID-19"
Saad Moro

This project was created for my Masters in Statistics at Oregon State University. This folder contains two data sets which are used by the R program. "us-counties.csv" contains daily positive COVID-19 cases by county data and was taken from the New York Times COVID-19 dataset. "county-data-abridged.csv" contains county-level public health data collected by UC Berkeley's Bin Yu Group. The R program implements synthetic control methods for interrupted time series experiments, to test the effect of a specific intervention occuring at some date on total COVID-19 positive cases in a specified county.

The R program, "synthetic.R", implements two functions.

county_timeseries takes a county and state as arguments and produces a dataset of total COVID-19 cases by county for a specific state. Each column represents an individual county, and each row corresponds to a day. 

synthetic_rally is the primary function of this R program. A county, state, and date are taken as arguments. First, the time series for every county in the specified state are cropped so to be 10 weeks long: 7 weeks prior to the specified date (the date of a specific intervention, such as a political rally or the beginning of a new policy), and 3 weeks after. Public health data covariates are attached as additional rows prior to the time series of each county. The specified county's column is then separated from the rest of the county time series in a given state. Using Alberto Abadie's "Synth" package, a "synthetic control" time series for the specified county is then created as a convex combination of the remaining counties (which should not have received the treatment the specified county did at the specified date). This results in a "synthetic" version of the treated county column which should very closely resemble the covariates and time series data of the original county. If a valid synthetic control was created, the two time series should be parallel up to the treatment date, at which point variation between the two might occur (if there was an observable effect resulting from the treatment). The function outputs a ggplot2 object which may be viewed by calling the object, which plots the two time series of COVID-19 cases on the same set of axes, and marks the date of treatment. By adjusting the interior code of the method, the output may be changed so that only time series data is created.

Additional code sits in the file to create a dataset of political rallies that occured in the summer and fall of 2020, which was used in my master's project.
